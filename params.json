In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSlapped together by Peter Weir (@ptweir) in 2015 for use in Michael Dickinson's laboratory.\r\n\r\n",
